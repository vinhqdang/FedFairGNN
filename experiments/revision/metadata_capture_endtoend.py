"""End-to-end capture of published fairness-aware aggregators via a false report.

The paper's central claim is that steering aggregation on a statistic each client
reports about *itself* is an attack surface. Until now that was demonstrated only
against BFWA, which is our own construction -- a reviewer correctly objected that
a baseline built to consume the falsified fields cannot substantiate a claim about
the literature. This runs the attack end-to-end against rules taken from published
methods, and against two that read no metadata at all as controls.

Three arms, so the damage can be attributed to the channel rather than to the
update:

    clean          no adversary
    poison_honest  adversary trains to maximise disparity, reports truthfully
    poison_lie     same update, best-response false report

Without ``poison_honest`` a drop under ``poison_lie`` could be the poisoned
gradient rather than the lie, and the claim would not follow.

Backbone is held at GCN for every arm so the contrast is between aggregation
rules and nothing else. Two registry entries differ from their METHODS defaults
under this constraint (f2gnn is GAT there, fltrust is trustfedgnn); the caption
must say so.

The adversary lies only about fairness/utility statistics, never about ``n``.
Sample count is a different channel, and an adversary permitted to inflate it
would also capture plain FedAvg -- collapsing the distinction this experiment
exists to draw. See attacks.BEST_RESPONSE_LIE.
