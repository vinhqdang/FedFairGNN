"""Byzantine / adversarial client behaviours for the robustness study.

Two families:
  * data-level  -- ``label_flip`` corrupts a malicious client's local labels
    before training (handled in the client via a flag).
  * update-level -- the attacker crafts its transmitted pseudo-gradient (and,
    for ``fairness_poison``, its *reported* fairness/utility metrics) after
    seeing benign updates. Applied server-side over the collected updates,
    which is the standard omniscient-attacker model.

Supported update-level attacks
    gaussian         additive large-variance noise.
    scaling          model-replacement: scale the update up by ``intensity``.
    sign_flip        negate and scale (drives the model the wrong way).
    ipm              inner-product manipulation: -eps * mean(benign).
    alie             "A Little Is Enough": mean(benign) - z * std(benign).
    fairness_poison  send a biased update but *report* DPD~=0 & high utility to
                     capture BFWA's fairness-based weighting (attack on ours).

Calibration of the two *stealth* attacks
----------------------------------------
``ipm`` and ``alie`` are not magnitude attacks: their whole point is that the
malicious update stays inside the benign population's spread so that a
distance/median screen cannot separate it. Driving them with the shared
``attack_intensity`` (10.0, sized for ``scaling``/``sign_flip``) destroys that
property and silently turns both into plain scaling attacks. They therefore
take their own parameters, ``ipm_epsilon`` and ``alie_z``; see the docstrings
of :func:`alie_z_from_counts` and the notes in :func:`poison_updates`.

    """ALIE deviation coefficient z, calibrated from the client counts.

    Baruch, Baruch & Goldberg, "A Little Is Enough: Circumventing Defenses For
    Distributed Learning" (NeurIPS 2019), Section 3. With ``n`` workers of which
    ``f`` are Byzantine, the attacker needs at least ``s`` benign workers to end
    up on its side of the coordinate-wise ordering for a median-style rule to be
    captured::

        s     = floor(n / 2 + 1) - f
        z_max = Phi^-1( (n - f - s) / (n - f) )

    where ``Phi^-1`` is the standard-normal quantile function. The poisoned
    update is then ``mean(benign) - z_max * std(benign)``: a perturbation
    measured in units of the benign population's own standard deviation, which
    is exactly what makes it survive range/median screening. A hardcoded z (the
    previous ``z = 1.5``) ignores both ``n`` and ``f`` and typically lands far
    outside the benign range, i.e. it is trivially detectable and is no longer
    the ALIE attack.

    Direction of the dependence: the numerator ``n - f - s`` simplifies to
    ``n - floor(n/2 + 1)``, which does not depend on ``f``, while the
    denominator ``n - f`` shrinks as ``f`` grows. The quantile argument, and
    hence ``z_max``, is therefore *non-decreasing* in ``f`` for fixed ``n`` --
    the more of the population the attacker controls, the further it may push
    the shared mean while still hiding inside the surviving benign spread. (For
    small ``f/n`` the quantile falls below 0.5 and ``z_max`` is negative, i.e.
    the safe perturbation points the other way; this is the paper's formula
    behaving as intended, not a sign bug.)

    Practical consequence worth knowing before reading a robustness table: the
    calibrated z is small, and sometimes zero or negative, for the small client
    populations used in cross-silo FL. At ``n = 10, f = 2`` (the repo's 20%
    Byzantine default) the closed form gives exactly ``z = 0``, i.e. the honest
    ALIE attacker may not deviate from the benign mean at all without becoming
    detectable -- calibrated ALIE is genuinely powerless at that operating
    point, which the old hardcoded ``z = 1.5`` concealed by launching a
    different, easily-screened attack instead. Set ``cfg.alie_z`` explicitly to
    study a deliberately over-aggressive attacker.

    ``ipm_epsilon``
        Xie, Koyejo & Gupta, "Fall of Empires: Breaking Byzantine-tolerant SGD
        by Inner Product Manipulation" (UAI 2019). The malicious update is
        ``-eps * mean(benign)``, which makes the aggregate point against the
        descent direction (negative inner product with the true gradient) while
        the attack REQUIRES ``eps < 1`` so the crafted vector stays inside the
        benign radius and survives screening. At the old ``eps = intensity =
        10`` the attack degenerated into ``scaling`` with a flipped sign and
        lost its defining stealth property. Default 0.5 mirrors
        ``ExperimentConfig.ipm_epsilon``.
