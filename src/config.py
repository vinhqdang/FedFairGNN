"""Experiment configuration and reproducibility utilities.

All experiments in this repository are driven by an :class:`ExperimentConfig`
dataclass so that every reported number can be traced back to an exact,
serialisable configuration. This is a deliberate design choice for a research
artifact: the manuscript's tables and figures are regenerated from logged runs,
not hand-authored.
