"""FU-Shapley incentive aggregation for FairShare-GNN.

The server evaluates each client's contribution *without trusting any self-
reported metadata* by aligning the client pseudo-gradient ``g_k = theta_global -
theta_local_k`` against a *target gradient* computed independently on the pooled
validation set:

    g_target = g_task + alpha * g_fair                            (FU-SV target)
    phi_k    = <g_k, g_target>                                    (contribution)
    w_k      = ReLU(EMA(phi_k)) / sum_j ReLU(EMA(phi_j))          (simplex weight)

Design decisions locked after the area-chair review (see
``../../implementation_plan_and_ac_review.md`` PART A):

* **F1 — sign is PLUS.** ``g_fair = +grad L_fair`` is the *ascent* gradient of
  the fairness surrogate. A client that *descends* fairness loss (reduces the
  demographic-parity gap) produces ``g_k`` aligned with ``g_fair`` -> positive
  fairness credit. The proposal's original minus sign would have penalised
  exactly the fairness-improving clients.
* **F2 — coordinate layout follows ``state_dict()``**, zero-filling entries with
  no gradient (BatchNorm buffers). This makes ``g_target`` line up coordinate-
  for-coordinate with ``flatten_state(state_dict())`` used to build ``g_k`` in
  the trainer. Building the target from ``model.parameters()`` alone would give
  a shorter, mis-ordered vector.
* **F3 — the task target uses the client's own loss** (``_weighted_bce``) on the
  ``val_mask``, so ``phi_util`` measures alignment with the *same* objective the
  clients optimise.
* **F5 — the server fairness surrogate defaults to ``(mu0 - mu1)**2``** (smooth),
  whose gradient vanishes gracefully as fairness is achieved. The client keeps
  the non-smooth ``|mu0 - mu1|`` unchanged.
* **F6 — per-round scaling defaults to ``target_norm``** (divide by
  ``||g_target||``): it removes the cross-round scale drift (as ``g_task -> 0``
  near convergence) while *preserving the sign* of ``phi``, so the ReLU gate
  keeps meaning "actively harmful" rather than "below average". ``zscore`` is
  offered for ablation only -- it recentres and therefore always gates roughly
  half the clients (and is degenerate for small K).

This module is intentionally NOT re-exported from ``trust/__init__`` to keep the
package import graph acyclic (it imports from ``federated.client``).

    ``phi_ema`` is NaN it stays NaN forever, even after ``phi_raw`` recovers --
    and because ``nan > 0`` is False the rule then silently degrades to FedAvg,
    handing the attacker a full ``1/K`` share. So: coordinates whose score is
    non-finite this round **hold their previous EMA value** instead of being
    updated (D2), and on the very first round they are set to 0, i.e. gated out
